    <h1>Rearrange the array with alternate high and low elements</h1>
    <p>
      Given an array of integers, rearrange the array such that every second element of the array is greater than its left and right elements. Assume no duplicate elements are present in the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      <p>
        Input:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
      </p>
      Output: {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6}
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple solution would be to sort the array in ascending order first. Then we take another auxiliary array and fill it with elements starting from the two end-points of the sorted array in alternate order.
