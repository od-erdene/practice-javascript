<h2>4.10 From apply() to the spread operator (...)</h2>

In ES5, you turn arrays into parameters via apply(). ES6 has the spread operator for this purpose.

<h3>4.10.1 Math.max()</h3>

Math.max() returns the numerically greatest of its arguments. It works for an arbitrary number of arguments, but not for Arrays.

ES5 – apply():

> Math.max.apply(Math, [-1, 5, 11, 3])
11
ES6 – spread operator:

> Math.max(...[-1, 5, 11, 3])
11

<h3>4.10.2 Array.prototype.push()</h3>

Array.prototype.push() appends all of its arguments as elements to its receiver. There is no method that destructively appends an Array to another one.

ES5 – apply():
```
var arr1 = ['a', 'b'];
var arr2 = ['c', 'd'];

arr1.push.apply(arr1, arr2);
    // arr1 is now ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

ES6 – spread operator:
```
const arr1 = ['a', 'b'];
const arr2 = ['c', 'd'];

arr1.push(...arr2);
    // arr1 is now ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```
