<h2>4.12 From function expressions in object literals to method definitions</h2>

In JavaScript, methods are properties whose values are functions.

In ES5 object literals, methods are created like other properties. The property values are provided via function expressions.
```
var obj = {
    foo: function () {
        ···
    },
    bar: function () {
        this.foo();
    }, // trailing comma is legal in ES5
}
```

ES6 has method definitions, special syntax for creating methods:
```
const obj = {
    foo() {
        ···
    },
    bar() {
        this.foo();
    },
}
```
