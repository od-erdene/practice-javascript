<h2>4.15 From objects to Maps</h2>

Using the language construct object as a map from strings to arbitrary values (a data structure) has always been a makeshift solution in JavaScript. The safest way to do so is by creating an object whose prototype is null. Then you still have to ensure that no key is ever the string '__proto__', because that property key triggers special functionality in many JavaScript engines.

The following ES5 code contains the function countWords that uses the object dict as a map:
```
var dict = Object.create(null);
function countWords(word) {
    var escapedWord = escapeKey(word);
    if (escapedWord in dict) {
        dict[escapedWord]++;
    } else {
        dict[escapedWord] = 1;
    }
}
function escapeKey(key) {
    if (key.indexOf('__proto__') === 0) {
        return key+'%';
    } else {
        return key;
    }
}
```

In ES6, you can use the built-in data structure Map and don’t have to escape keys. As a downside, incrementing values inside Maps is less convenient.

```
const map = new Map();
function countWords(word) {
    const count = map.get(word) || 0;
    map.set(word, count + 1);
}
```
Another benefit of Maps is that you can use arbitrary values as keys, not just strings.
